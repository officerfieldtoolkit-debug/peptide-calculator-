Hi [Vendor Name] Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out because I've built a **free peptide tracking tool** called **PeptideLog** that I think would be valuable for your customers.

**What is PeptideLog?**
PeptideLog (https://peptidelog.net) is a free web app that helps peptide users:
- 📊 Track their injections and dosages
- 🧮 Calculate reconstitution (BAC water ratios)
- 📅 Schedule doses with reminders
- 📈 Monitor their progress over time
- 💰 Compare prices across vendors (you're listed!)

**Why Partner?**
- **Zero cost** – It's free for your customers
- **Better retention** – Users who track are more likely to reorder
- **Builds trust** – Shows you care about responsible use
- **Your vendor listing** – You're featured in our price comparison

**What I'm Asking:**
Would you consider mentioning PeptideLog to your customers? This could be:
- A link in your order confirmation emails
- A mention on your website resources page
- A social media post

I'm not asking for money or affiliate deals – just exposure. In return, I'll ensure your vendor listing stays accurate and prioritized.

Happy to jump on a quick call if you'd like to learn more.

Best regards,

### r/Peptides Post

**Title:** I built a free peptide tracking app – would love feedback

---

Hey everyone,

I've been using peptides for [X time] and got tired of tracking everything in spreadsheets and notes apps. So I built **PeptideLog** – a free web app specifically for the peptide community.

**What it does:**
- 📊 **Injection Log** – Track every dose with date, time, and notes
- 🧮 **Reconstitution Calculator** – Never mess up your BAC water math again
- 📅 **Schedule & Reminders** – Set recurring doses with push notifications
- 📈 **Progress Analytics** – See your usage patterns over time
- 💰 **Price Checker** – Compare prices across vendors
- 📚 **Encyclopedia** – Quick reference for 50+ peptides

**Why I built it:**
I wanted something simple that wasn't a generic health app. Most fitness trackers don't understand peptides, half-lives, or reconstitution. This is built specifically for us.

**It's free:**
No paywalls for the core features. Works on any device (it's a PWA so you can install it like an app).

**Check it out:** https://peptidelog.net

Would really appreciate any feedback. What features would you want to see added?

### r/Peptides Comment (When Relevant)

**When someone asks about tracking:**
```
I use PeptideLog (peptidelog.net) for this exact thing. It's a free web app built specifically for peptides – has injection logging, reconstitution calculator, and scheduling. Works great on mobile too.
```

**When someone asks about reconstitution:**
```
There's a free calculator at peptidelog.net that does all the math for you. Just enter your peptide amount, BAC water volume, and desired dose – it tells you exactly how many units to draw.
```

**When someone asks about vendors/prices:**
```
PeptideLog has a price checker that compares prices across vendors. It's at peptidelog.net/prices – not affiliated with any vendor, just aggregates the data.
```

### r/Biohackers Post

**Title:** Free tool for tracking peptides, nootropics, and supplements

---

Fellow biohackers,

Built a tracking tool that I think some of you might find useful. It's called **PeptideLog** and while it started as a peptide tracker, it works for any injectable or supplement protocol.

**Features:**
- Track any compound with custom dosing
- Calculate reconstitution for lyophilized peptides
- Visualize your usage with charts
- Set reminders for complex protocols
- Log side effects and notes
- Export your data anytime

**Why not just use a spreadsheet?**
You could! But this has a proper mobile UI, push notifications, and it calculates your dosing automatically based on half-life.

**Free at:** https://peptidelog.net

Built this for myself but figured the community might benefit. Open to feature requests if you try it out.

### r/Semaglutide or r/Tirzepatide Post

**Title:** Free app for tracking your GLP-1 doses

---

Hey all,

I see a lot of posts asking about tracking doses, so I wanted to share a free tool I built.

**PeptideLog** (https://peptidelog.net) lets you:
- ✅ Log each injection with exact dose and time
- ✅ Calculate how much to draw based on your reconstitution
- ✅ Set weekly reminders
- ✅ Track your progress over time
- ✅ Compare vendor prices

It's specifically built for peptides (not a generic health app), so it understands things like mcg dosing, reconstitution ratios, and weekly injection schedules.

**Free to use** – no credit card or anything. Just works in your browser or install it as an app on your phone.

Hope it helps someone! Let me know if you have any questions.
